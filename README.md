i Primer Servidor

Task where we build a simple HTTP server using Node.js.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install Node.js (preferably version 14.x or higher)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/julianmonzon/mi_primer_servidor.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd mi_primer_servidor

3. Install dependencies (if any):

npm install

4. Since this is a simple server, you can proceed to run it directly:

node index.js

To view the server in action, open a browser and go to:

http://localhost:3000

It will display a simple "Hola Mundo" message.
